Maria manuscript
- what data have gone through QA/QC in a publication?
- thermal FLIR data geotiffs 

BETYDB
- date_loc and time_loc for level of confidence - do we have timestamps on traits from fullfield data, and if so should we set LOC to indicate only day level is valid?
- trait data internally converted to GMT - are we handling properly on GET requests?



AZ PIPELINE TRANSFER
How was Kubernetes provisioned? Which OS? (what's the RKT) etc.
